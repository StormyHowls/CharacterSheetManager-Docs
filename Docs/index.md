# **Character Sheet Manager**
### A character sheet manager for the tabletop role-playing game Werewolf: The Apocalypse.

Although it is heavily inspired by the game, it is not an official product of White Wolf Publishing, Inc. or any of its affiliates. 
The game is a work of fiction and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.

The character sheet manager is a tool for players and storytellers to manage their characters and campaigns.

## Features
