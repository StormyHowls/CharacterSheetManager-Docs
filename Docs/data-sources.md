# Trait Data and Sources

Much of the data was pulled from the fan-made excel document **"Werewolf the Apocalypse Reference"** by R. Derek Pattison although it
was written in a way so that data didn't repeat itself, so I had to reconstruct information based on his reference pointers.
His research made it possible to jump start this project, but there is still a lot of information to incorporate.
